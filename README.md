# MusicMatch-Landing-Page
A simple landing page of a fictional app/website that allows people to find their match based on their music taste. Built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

This project leveraged an extensive use of Bootstrap grid system and components like navbar, containers, buttons and carousel. I have also used CSS Flexbox to style a full section of this landing page as a practice.
